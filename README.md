A simple puzzle game I created in 2017 to practice full-stack development

The concept was to create a simple puzzle game, for practice implementing game logic, event sequencing, and simple graphics. I first wrote a prototype for the game systems in Python, using the command line as game input.

I wanted to host the game on an easily accessible webpage, and decided it would be easiest to rewrite everything for the web from the ground up. I cobbled together the HTML and CSS, then translated over my Python into Javascript/jQuery.

The game is now feature complete, and I have put the project to rest, for the time being at least. I came up with six types of puzzle pieces, wrote introductory level packs teaching the user the game mechanics, and made two challenge modes involving a rolling time limit and limited lives.

These last two modes utilized an algorithm I wrote for procedurally generating random solvable levels of my game.
